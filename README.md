# GamingLobbyServer
A Gaming Lobby designed using WPF and C# .NET delegates and asynchronous functions to implement a multithreaded server solution..

The program runs by locally hosting a console dataserver and then WPF clients can connect using unique usernames.
Once logged in users can select if any lobbies are available capped at five lobbies at a time.
If no lobbies are present, a user can select a name and create one, the program dynamically refreshes for lobbies but a manual button was added as well.

Below are screenshots of the program running.
